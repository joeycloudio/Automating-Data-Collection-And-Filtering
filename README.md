Automating Job Data
===================

Overview
--------

**Automating Job Data** is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of collecting job postings based on predefined criteria. It helps job seekers quickly extract relevant job listings, reducing manual search time and improving efficiency. The script currently focuses on gathering job data from online job boards, making it easier to analyze and filter high-quality opportunities.

Features
--------

*   Automates job search based on custom parameters (e.g., role title, filters).
    
*   Extracts job titles and descriptions for further analysis.
    
*   Saves job data into a structured CSV file (job\_data.csv) for easy review.
    
*   Handles pagination and ensures all relevant listings are collected.
    
*   Reduces time spent reviewing unsuitable job postings.
    

Future Enhancements
-------------------

*   **Filtering Script**: A separate module to refine and analyze extracted job data.
    
*   **Skill Matching**: Implementing a feature to compare job descriptions against a predefined set of relevant skills.
    
*   **Company & Location Extraction**: Adding structured fields for company names and job locations.
    
*   **More Robust Error Handling**: Improving reliability when navigating dynamic pages.
